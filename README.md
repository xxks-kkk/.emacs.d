===================
Emacs Configuration
===================

Given a certain level of usability, this emacs configuration aims to provide minimal set of config files, plugins, commands
with maximum amount of portability, stability, and scalability.

By maximum amount of portability, I mean to avoid external package installation as much as possible as different release of UNIX-like
systems and different versions of emacs may hinder the portability of this configuration.
